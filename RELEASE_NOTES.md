# 3.11.0

## New features

- Go to definition now works reliably across all Dafny language constructs and across files. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2734)

- Improve performance of Go code by using native byte/char arrays (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2818)

- Introduce the experimental `measure-complexity` command, whose output can be fed to the Dafny report generator. In a future update, we expect to merge the functionality of the report generator into this command. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3061)

- Integrate the Dafny [auditor plugin](https://github.com/dafny-lang/compiler-bootstrap/tree/main/src/Tools/Auditor) as a built-in `dafny audit` command. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3175)

- Add the `--solver-path` option to allow customizing the SMT solver used when using the new Dafny CLI user interface. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3184)

- Add the experimental `--test-assumptions` option to all execution commands: run, build, translate and test.
  When turned on, inserts runtime tests at locations where (implicit) assumptions occur, such as when calling or being called by external code and when using assume statements.
  Functionality is still being expanded. Currently only checks contracts on every call to a function or method marked with the {:extern} attribute.
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3185)

- For the command `translate`, renamed the option `--target` into `language` and turned it into a mandatory argument. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3239)

- Havoc assignments now count as assignments for definite-assignment checks. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3311)

- Unless `--enforce-determinism` is used, no errors are given for arrays that are allocated without being initialized.
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3311)

- Enable passing a percentage value to the --cores option, to use a percentage of the total number of logical cores on the machine for verification. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3357)

- `dafny build` for Java now creates a library or executable jar file.
  - If there is a Main method, the jar is an executable jar. So a simple A.dfy can be built as `dafny build -t:java A.dfy`
    and then run as `java -jar A.jar`
  - If there is no Main entry point, all the generated class files are assembled into a library jar file that can be used on a
    classpath as a java library.
  - In both cases, the DafnyRuntime library is included in the generated jar.
  - In old and new CLIs, the default location and name of the jar file is the name of the first dfy file, with the extension changed
  - In old and new CLIs, the path and name of the output jar file can be given by the --output option, with .jar added if necessary
  - As before, the compilation artifacts (.java and .class files) are placed in a directory whose name is the same as the jar file
    but without the .jar extension and with '-java' appended
  - With the new CLI, the generated .java artifacts are deleted unless --spill-translation=true and the .class files are deleted in any case;
    both kinds of files are retained with the legacy CLI for backwards compatibility.
  - If any other jar files are needed to compile the dafny/java program, they must be on the CLASSPATH;
    the same CLASSPATH used to compile the program is needed to run the program

  Having a library or executable jar simplifies the user's task in figuring out how to use the built artifacts.
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3355)

## Bug fixes

- Nonexistent files passed on the CLI now result in a graceful exit (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2719)

- Improved error messages for `dafny translate` (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3274)

- The :test attribute is now compatible with `dafny run` and `dafny build` (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3275)

- Settings `--cores=0` will cause Dafny to use half of the available cores. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3276)

- Removed an infeasible assertion in the Dafny Runtime for Java (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3280)

- Language server displays more relevant information on hovering assertions (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3281)

- Any `(==)` inferred for a type parameter of an iterator is now also inferred for the corresponding non-null iterator type. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3284)

- The otherwise ambiguous program fragment `export least predicate` is parsed such that `least` (or `greatest`) is the export identifier (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3291)

- The parser no longer generates bad tokens when invoked through `/library` (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3301)

- Match expressions no longer incorrectly convert between newtypes and their basetype (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3333)

- Warn that 'new' cannot be used in expressions, instead of throwing a parse error (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3366)

- The attributes `:dllimport` and `:handle` are now deprecated. They were undocumented, untested, and not maintained. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3399)

- Fixed an axiom related to sequence comprehension extraction (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3411)

- The definition of the `char` type will change in Dafny version 4, to represent any Unicode scalar value instead of any UTF-16 code unit.
  The new command-line option `--unicode-char` allows early adoption of this mode.
  See section [7.5](http://dafny.org/dafny/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-characters) of the Reference Manual for more details.
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/3016)

- Previously, for a file printing the number of arguments, `dafny printing.dfy -compileTarget:js --args 1 2 3` would print 4: one for the executable, one for each argument.
  But `dafny -compile:2 -compileTarget:js printing.dfy; node ./printing.js` would print 5: One for `node`, one for `./printing.js`, and one for each argument.
  This fix ensures that `node ./printing.js` is considered as a single argument, and the first argument, to be consistent with every other language.
  (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2876)

- Handle sequence-to-string equality correctly in the JavaScript runtime (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2877)

- fix: multiset keyword no longer crashes the parser (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/2079)


# 3.5.0

- feat: `continue` statements. Like Dafny's `break` statements, these come in two forms: one that uses a label to name the continue target and one that specifies the continue target by nesting level. See section [19.2](https://dafny-lang.github.io/dafny/DafnyRef/DafnyRef#sec-break-continue) of the Reference Manual. (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/1839)

# 3.4

- For certain classes of changes to a Dafny program, prevent unexpected changes in verification behavior.
- Add command line options to assist in debugging verification performance.
- Critical fixes to the IDE and greatly improved responsiveness of non-verification IDE features.
- The C# back-end supports traits as type parameters on datatypes.

### Verification
- feat: Prevent changes in the verification behavior of a proof, when any of these types of changes are made to Dafny user code:
  - Changes to declarations not referenced by the method being verified
  - Changes to the name of any declaration
  - Changes to the order of top-level declarations
- feat: Assist in debugging the verification performance of a proof by adding the `/vcsSplitOnEveryAssert` CLI option and `{:vcs_split_on_every_assert}` attribute (see https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie/issues/465), and report the outcome and duration of splits when they occur in `/verificationLogger:trx` content.
- feat: Add a `/verificationLogger:csv` CLI option that emits the same status and timing information as `/verificationLogger:trx`, but in an easier-to-parse format, along with Z3 resource counts for more repeatable tracking of verification difficulty.

- fix: Resolve unsoundness issue (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1619).
- fix: Don't silently succeed if the solver crashes (https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie/pull/488).

### IDE
- feat: Verification status reporting shows which proof is being verified, which can help debug slow to verify proofs.
- feat: Publish parsing and resolution diagnostics before verification has completed. Verification diagnostics from previous runs are migrated.
- feat: Enable 'go to definition', 'hover' and 'signature help' features before verification has completed.
- feat: Improve the hover feature to work for a wider scope of Dafny constructs, including function and method parameters, forall, exists and let expressions, and set and map comprehensions.
- feat: Add an experimental verification caching feature, which enables automatically determining which proofs need to verify again after making changes.
- feat: Display related resolution errors using nested diagnostics instead of independent diagnostics.

- fix: Clean up process resources if IDE closed or restarted.
- fix: Do not let the Dafny compilation status bar get in a stuck state.

### UX
- feat: Improve error reporting when providing incorrectly typed arguments in a function call.
- feat: Improve error reporting when using type tests.

### C#
- feat: Support variant type parameters on datatype definitions, which enables using traits as type arguments (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1499).
- feat: Support for downcasting both custom datatypes and functions (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/1645, https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/pull/1755).

- fix: Resolve various instances where Dafny would produce invalid C# code (https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1607, https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1761, and https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny/issues/1762).

### Various improvements
- fix: `DafnyLanguageServer.dll` and `Dafny.dll` depended on two different versions of Newtonsoft.Json, which could cause crashes in development environments.
- fix: (error reporting) Types with the same name but from different modules are now disambiguated in error messages.
- fix: (error reporting) Messages about arguments / parameters type mismatch are clearer and include the parameter name if available.
- fix: (robustness) Exceptions during parsing, if any, won't crash the language server anymore.
- fix: The elephant operator (`:-`) has a clearer error message and no longer reject generic methods on its right-hand side.

## Breaking changes

- The verifier in Dafny 3.4 is now more efficient for many programs, and making changes to Dafny programs is less likely to cause verification to take longer or timeout. However, it is still possible for some correct programs to take longer to verify than on Dafny 3.3, or for verification to fail. For users with such programs who are not yet ready to modify them to pass the 3.4 verifier, we offer the command line option `/mimicVerificationOf:3.3` to keep the Dafny 3.4 verification behavior consistent with 3.3.

- In Dafny 3.3, comprehensions quantified over subset types did not validate the constraint of the subset type, which could result in crashes at run-time. In 3.4, subset types are disabled in set comprehensions in compiled contexts, unless the subset constraint is itself compilable.

  Before, the following code would pass Dafny and be compiled without error, but would crash at run-time:
  ```Dafny
  type RefinedData = x: Data | ghostFunction(x)
  method Main() {
    var s: set<Data> = ...
    var t = set x: RefinedData | x in s;
    forall x in t {
      if !ghostFunction(x) {
        var crash := 1/0;
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  In Dafny 3.4, the same code triggers a resolution error of the form:
  ```
  Error: RefinedData is a subset type and its constraint is not compilable, hence it cannot yet be used as the type of a bound variable in set comprehension. The next error will explain why the constraint is not compilable.
  Error: ghost constants are allowed only in specification contexts
  ```

- Changes in type inference may cause some programs to need manual type annotations. For example, in the nested pattern in the following program
  ```Dafny
  datatype X<+T> = X(x: T)
  datatype Y<T> = Y(y: T)

  function method M(): (r: X<Y<nat>>) {
      var d: X<Y<int>> := X(Y(3));
      match d
      case X(Y(i)) => X(Y(i))
  }
  ```
  the type of the Y constructor needs the type to be given explicitly `X(Y<nat>.Y(i)`. As a variation of that program
  ```Dafny
  datatype X<+T> = X(x: T)
  datatype Y<T> = Y(y: T)

  trait Tr {}
  class Cl extends Tr {
      constructor () {}
  }

  method M() returns (r: X<Y<Cl>>) {
      var cl := new Cl();
      var d: X<Y<Tr>> := X(Y(cl));
      match d
      case X(Y(tr)) => r := X(Y(tr));
  }
  ```
  the program can be specified with an explicit cast `X(Y(tr as Cl))`.
