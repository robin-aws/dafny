Add the experimental `--test-assumptions` option to all execution commands: run, build, translate and test.
When turned on, inserts runtime tests at locations where (implicit) assumptions occur, such as when calling or being called by external code and when using assume statements.
Functionality is still being expanded. Currently only checks contracts on every call to a function or method marked with the {:extern} attribute.
